# Dynamic-fees-extension: Enabling Custom Fee Models on Ekubo
This project introduces a foundational Internal Swap Pool (ISP) for Ekubo DEX, designed to open up the world of custom dynamic fees on Starknet.

We're moving beyond static fee structures. The Dynamic-fees-extension serves as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating how a modular and intuitive framework can allow developers to build and deploy their own unique fee models.
